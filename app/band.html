        <p>Homer: Hello, I'd like to speak to a Mr. Snotball, first name Ura. Moe: Ura Snotball? Homer: What? How dare you. If I find out who this is, I'll staple a flag to your butt and mail you to Iran. Bart: Lis, you made the school worse than it already was. It wasn't exactly San Diego State to begin with. Marge: I can't help but feel this is all my fault. It was those North Korean fortune cookies - they were so insulting. "You are a coward." Nobody wants to hear that after a nice meal. Homer: Marge, you can't keep blaming yourself. Just blame yourself once, then move on. Homer: [looking at a picture of refugees in a newspaper] Look at these refugees, Marge. Not even a smile. Marge: They've undergone terrible hardships. Homer: Well, moping won't help anything! Lenny: There's nothing like revenge for getting back at people. Carl: Vengeance isn't too bad either</p>
